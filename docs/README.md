# MEVN Actions Starter Kit

This repository provides a minimal MEVN stack (MongoDB, Express, Vue, Node.js) boilerplate with GitHub Actions workflows for CI/CD.

## Why choose Actions for your workflow?

- **Automation**: Save time by letting GitHub handle repetitive tasks.
- **Consistency**: Ensure every build, test, and deploy follows the same rules.
- **Confidence**: Catch bugs and vulnerabilities before they reach production.

```

## Included Workflows

- **CI Pipeline** (`ci.yml`): Runs ESLint and tests on every push/PR.
- **Build Workflow** (`build.yml`): Compiles the Vue frontend automatically on push to main.
- **Deploy Workflow** (`deploy.yml`): Template for deployments (manual trigger only — configure secrets before use).
- **Security Workflow** (`security.yml`): Runs CodeQL analysis for vulnerabilities in JavaScript and TypeScript.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Copy `server/.env.example` to `server/.env` and fill in the values.
3. Configure secrets in GitHub repository settings for deployment (e.g., `HEROKU_API_KEY`, `RENDER_API_KEY`).
4. Push your code and watch the workflows run.

## 📚 Documentação Adicional

- **[Lista Curada de Actions](./curated-actions.md)**: Catálogo completo de GitHub Actions recomendadas para MEVN, organizadas por domínio (CI, Build, Deploy, Security).

## Brainstorming Questions

- Why is CI important for small teams as well as large ones?
- When should you trigger deploys automatically, and when should you hold them back?
- How can security scans be integrated without slowing down development?
- What happens if you skip automation entirely?
- Should builds run on every branch, or only on main?
- Is deploying every commit sustainable, or should you prefer tagged releases?

This starter kit is not just about automation — it's about **thinking critically** about your workflow. Use these files as a foundation, and adapt them to your own needs.
